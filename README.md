IMPORTANT NOTE :
- If the meeting chat doesn't works at the very first time after you create a team and start a meet , try doing it for a second time because depending on your device the app may take up some time setting up the permissions required.
- Best you can do is that, after you create a team , just send a normal message first and then start a meeting. This is just one timer thing to set up everything required for the video and chat to work on each specific devices. Just to keep everything checked.

TECH STACK :
- Flutter (For UI)
- Dart(Backend)
- For video calling(Agora SDK)
- Database (Firebase Cloud Firestore)

HOW TO USE :

1. Sign in through your google account (The app will only take the basic data like username, email , profile photo url etc and not even the phone number) after completing the local authentication(including fingerprint and face ID).

	- After deleting the chat, either you can refresh the page by pull to refresh or you can just click on that particular card and it will disappear.
5. For the teams part , you can create your own team and add members to it and continue with the video conferencing with real time simultaneous chat functionalities.
	- Just click on the triple dots icon at the top app bar beside the search icon and you will see an option to create a team.

	- When the host of the meeting joins and shuts down the meeting , then the meeting will not be accessible to anyone anymore and it will be turned off.
	- If you schedule a meeting for later time on a particular day, the chat will be available for users to use and continue in the meeting after it starts and even continue the same chat after the meeting ends.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73520130/125171124-224f4680-e1d0-11eb-8fbe-dab84268ea0c.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73520130/125171128-2a0eeb00-e1d0-11eb-9897-30a782fd49ee.png)

	- Use that icon to create and join an instant meet and you can even send invite emails to the members of the team while starting the meeting using a switch which will be available when you create an instant meeting from a popup.
	- Just send a normal message before starting a meet if you just created a team(else it may cause internet permission issues to connect to database).
	- Please refer to the "IMPORTANT NOTE" at the top of this file.

10. Finally there will be a logout option which as the name suggests will log you out of the application and you will be prompted to the login page.

8. Additionally :

	- Everywhere in the application , you can click on any user's icon to view their profile similar to yours and can directly launch your device’s gmail app with “from” and “to” fields filled in already.
	- If your connection goes off while being in either the teams page or chat page , it will prompt you to a page with an image showcasing that you don't have a proper internet connection.

	- You can also long press the teams card and it will show a small toaster displaying that it is the general channel.
	- When you open the app it shows a toaster saying "Welcome!".
	- Front and back camera switching, mic on/off also works in the meeting.

AGILE METHODOLOGY USED(scrum and sprints):

Planning and Work done :

| DATE RANGE  | WORK DONE  |
| :------------ |:---------------:|

| 6-7 July    | Built meeting scheduling and before and after chat |
| 7-10 July    | Performed testing on different devices and fixed bugs and finished the project       |


Making the app dynamic and adaptable to changes :

- Used NoSQL database (Firebase Cloud Firestore) to be able to easily adapt to changes.
- Made use of the Flutter Null Safety functionality to avoid any sort of exceptions or suspensions.
- Synchronized the codebase and different packages used in the project to work without any issues.
- Separated the business logic and UI components and made the codes reusable.
- Provided comments to all the scripts.


LEARNINGS :

- Learned how to use real time connection APIs such as webRTC APIs , SDKs like Agora , Azure Communication Services and jitsi_meet sdk . Got to know how to properly thread APIs - together and get a real time connection working for the end users and also with a better integration of it with the UI component for the best user experience.
- Got to know about Agile methodology and its real implementation use case and how to plan , design , build and test the prototype within the sprints.
- Practiced and learned a lot of different queries and search algorithms for Cloud Firestore with Flutter.
- Used different dependencies/libraries for implementing different kinds of features starting from the very basics like showing a small toaster to building something like FingerPrint and FaceID authentication on top of Google Sign In.
- Learned how to implement fast and efficient searches integrated with UI and presenting everything in real time.
- Practiced a lot of Firebase Could Firestore queries in terms of multilevel collections and documents integrated with each other.
- Figured out how to implement a real time speech to text translation algorithm with the use of some dependencies keeping the UI minimalist and clean.
- Learned to separate the business logic and UI code as much as possible for the code to be understandable and clean, minimizing code duplication ultimately resulting in better performance.


CHALLENGES => HOW I OVERCAME THEM :

- The very first challenge I faced was implementing a real time video communication feature where I ran into a lot of errors and if working then bugs.
  
  --> Finally after reading through the Documentations and trying and testing out the code on different devices , I was able to make multiple nodes connect over the network for a real time audio and video call with simultaneous chat.
- Secondly, handling edge cases in different scripts was a big challenge , such as making sure that only the user having a sensor should be prompted to the authentication page for fingerprint or face ID and many different edge cases for the database entries.

  --> Testing out the application on different devices while making changes in the required changes in the codebase resolved the issues.
- Passing the appropriate data between different pages avoiding any memory leaks and overconsumption of memory or space seemed to have issues as at some places like scheduling a meeting and creating an after chat was having some bugs because of improper flags used.

  --> Reading through some threads and debugging the application resulted in solving the bugs.
- Finally making sure there are no known bugs for the features implemented for the end user to have a seamless experience was the biggest challenge.

  --> Continuous debugging and refining the scripts I was able to manage to fix every known bug (both the UI glitches or backend code suspensions).


FUTURE SCOPE (What I would have implemented if got more time):

The very first thing is that, whatever I was building , I wanted to apply everything I know and everything I learned during the development phase in the most efficient way.

- Talking about future scope, I would like to implement push notifications managed by the developer from the Firebase Console with different AI predictions for specific users.

- I would also like to enhance the searching algorithm using pattern matching algorithms and with use of more appropriate data structures throughout the application.

- There’s a lot to implement but finally I would like to work more on the security part for the users data protection (also including many more login APIs such as Microsoft and Facebook login).

INTERESTING AND MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES(according to me ) :

- Interesting :
  
  --> The speech to text and fingerprint and faceID authentication features seemed the most interesting to me as they are not the most traditional ones.
- Important :
  
  --> Scheduling a meeting and creating before and after chats.
  
  --> Mailing the members notifying about the start of an instant meeting (if the host wants to).
  
  --> Separate chat functionality for the users.
